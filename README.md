# 🤖 Machine Learning Fundamentals

This repository is my hands-on playground to learn and practice the basics of Machine Learning (ML) .
I'm starting with the essentials — linear regression , polynomial regression , regularization , cross-validation , and feature engineering — and building up from there.

🎯 The goal is to understand how models work , how to evaluate them , and how to improve performance using best practices.
